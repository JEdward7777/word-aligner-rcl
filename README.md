This is a fork of word-aligner-rcl.  word-aligner-rcl is a react component which allows a translator to connect source and target words in a translation and thus map out an alignment.  

This fork adds the addition of connecting an AI suggester for creating word alignments.

The demonstration app for this is [alignment-transferer](https://alignment-transferer.netlify.app/).
