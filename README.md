# suggesting-word-aligner-rcl

This is a fork of [word-aligner-rcl](https://github.com/unfoldingWord/word-aligner-rcl).  word-aligner-rcl is a react component which allows a translator to connect source and target words in a translation and thus map out an alignment.  

This fork adds the addition of connecting an AI suggester for creating word alignments.

The demonstration app for this is [Alignment Transferer](https://github.com/JEdward7777/alignment-transferer) which has a [Netlify demo.](https://alignment-transferer.netlify.app/).
